# Blackjack Program
This is a Java-based Blackjack program that allows you to play the popular card game against the computer, or simulate a game and track the results in an Excel file. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and follows the basic rules of Blackjack.

## How to Play
1. Run the Main.java file in a Java environment.
2. The game will prompt you to choose between two options:
    * To play against the computer, input '1'
    * To simulate a game and track results, input '2'
3. If you choose to play against the computer, the game will start and you will be dealt two cards face up, while the dealer will be dealt one card face up and one card face down.
4. If you choose to simulate a game, the program will automatically play a game of Blackjack and track the results in an Excel file. The simulation will continue until the player runs out of money.
